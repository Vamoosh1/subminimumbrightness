# subminimumbrightness
A lightweight app designed to reduce screen brightness below system minimums. No root required. Does not control phone's backlight.

At some point I'll probably fill this out with a whole long-winded explanation. The short version, though, is that I wanted a lightweight
app to pull the brightness down on my insanely bright phone screen. I also wanted to be certain that it wasn't a thinly-veiled attempt to
skim bank details off my screen. To that end, I asked OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 implementation to walk me through the steps to create an app to
achieve this goal. It provided me with instructions to produce this app. I had quite literally zero hand in making this besides copying
code out of a ChatGPT-4 window and pasting it into Android Studio where GPT told me it should go. To be clear: I didn't even have the 
Android devkit installed when I started. I had to ask GPT what software I needed. Everything about this app (besides the icon, once I get
around to giving it one) was generated by ChatGPT.
